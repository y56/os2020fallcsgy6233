# To compile and run

gcc -o hw4_2 hw4_2.c -lrt
./hw4_n d

gcc -o hw4_2v2 hw4_2v2.c -lrt
./hw4_2v2 n d

// n for number of elements
// d for interval

# If the parent creates the child process and then creates the anonymous shared memory, would your program work? Why?

I have used `hw4_2v2.c` to verify that; my program will work. The two prosecces can access to the same data segment by specifying the "name" (`"posixsm"` in my program). Although parent and child are live in different address space, kernel will map the address for them.
