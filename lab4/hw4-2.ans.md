# To compile and run

gcc

# If the parent creates the child process and then creates the anonymous shared memory, would your program work? Why?

I have used `hw2v2.c` to verify that; my program will work. The two prosecces can access to the same data segment by specifying the "name" (`"posixsm"` in my program). Although parent and child are live in different address space, kernel will map the address for them.
